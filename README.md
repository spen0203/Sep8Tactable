TODO'S / Improvements that could be made:

- Tests Could be expanded to cover all possible invalid values on both CTOR & deserializers.
    (Proved its testable, but did not cover all error cases due to time constraints.)

- JSON Deserializer functions could be expanded to support missing values and to perform type checks.

- CSS styles such as 'Next' & 'Prev' actions could use props to determine their style values.

- Opened blog posts could have a dedicated 'Author' section that would display their avatar or a  default image.

- Transition animations could be added to opening, closing and changing the selected post.

- Used react-bootstrap instead of bootstrap, rarely used it so it wasn't a huge concern but could be improved and used more.
